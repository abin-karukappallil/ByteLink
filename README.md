## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A Supabase account with a project set up for authentication and database use.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bytelink.git
   cd bytelink```

2. **Install all dependencies**:
   
   - Run the following command to install the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file:
     
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
3. **Setup Supabase**:

   - Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.io) and create a new project if you haven't already.
   - In your project, set up a database schema to store links (for example, create a `links` table with fields such as `id`, `original_url`, `shortened_url`, `user_id`, and `click_count`).
   - Retrieve your Supabase API URL and Anonymous Key from the Supabase project settings.
   - In the root directory of your project, create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:

     ```env
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

   - Save the `.env` file. This will allow your project to connect to Supabase for authentication and database storage.
